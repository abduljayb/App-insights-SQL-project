**Final recommendations from my analysis**

--Paid vs free apps. Analyzing the data, I figured out that paid apps generally get better ratings than free ones. It could be because users who invest in an app tend to be more engaged, resulting in elevated ratings.

--Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings.

--Finance and book apps have lower ratings. This indicates that user needs aren’t being fully met. This can represent a market opportunity for the client in the sense that, if the client can create a quality app in these categories that addresses user needs then there is an opportunity for market penetration.

--Apps with longer description have better ratings. The length of app description has a positive correlation with user ratings. Users prefer having a clear understanding of the app’s features and capabilities before they download

--A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5

--Games and entertainment apps have high competition. These categories have very high volume of apps suggesting the market may be saturated. However it also suggests high user demands in these categories
