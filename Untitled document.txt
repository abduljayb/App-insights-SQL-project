Project overview.


Working with a dataset that covers information about apps available on the apple store, this dataset was sourced from kaggle.com which is probably the number one source of free data on the internet.


Identifying the stakeholder.
In this project, the stakeholder is an aspiring app developer seeking data insights to know what app to build.


Questions.
These are a list of questions I had in mind before analysing the dataset 
* What app categories are most popular?
* What price should I set ?
* How can I maximize user ratings?
